				<p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, 
				a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all
				men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether 
				that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We 
				are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion 
				of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that 
				that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
				But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this
				ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, 
				far above our poor power to add or detract. <p/>

				<p id="rcorners2">The world will little note, nor long 
				remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for
				us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they
				who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here
				dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we
				take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure 
				of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in 
				vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that 
				government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from 
				the earth.</p>
